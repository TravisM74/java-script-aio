   The ternary operator
Conditional statements can also be written using the conditional operator. The 
conditional operator is also known as the ternary operator. The conditional operator shortens if ... else statements to a single expression, which is often useful 
when doing conditional rendering with ReactJS, Vue.js, or Svelte.

The break and continue statements can be used to interrupt the execution of a
